# Streamline

### Student Info

-   Name: Derek Kasmark
-   Section: 03/04

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: _top-down_
-   Camera Movement: _fixed_
-   Player Health: _lives_
-   End Condition: _endless/arcade_
-   Scoring: _points collected from defeating enemies_

### Game Description

_The player is in control of a spaceship, and has to shoot down waves of hostile forces that descend from the top of the screen. The player can move in any direction, and can fire bullets to destroy enemies. The player has a limited number of lives, and the game will only end when the player runs out._

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
    -   Down: ‚¨áÔ∏è
    -   Left: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
    -   Right: ‚û°Ô∏è
-   Fire: üÖæÔ∏è (Z)
-   Focus: ‚ùé (X)

## My Additions

_The game will feature a variety of procedural enemy patterns that scale in difficulty as the game progresses. Additionally, the player will be able to enter a "focus" state by holding down the ‚ùé (X) button, allowing them to slow down and make more precise movements._

## Known Issues

- Player bullets currently detect collision with the player after being instantiated, which may complicate collision handling. Will likely need to handle player and enemy collisions seperately in collision manager.

### Requirements not completed

None, currently.
