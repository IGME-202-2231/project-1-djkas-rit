## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: _top-down_
-   Camera Movement: _fixed_
-   Player Health: _lives_
-   End Condition: _endless/arcade_
-   Scoring: _points collected from defeating enemies_

### Game Description

_The player is in control of a spaceship, and has to hold the line against waves of hostile forces that descend from the top of the screen. Shooting down enemies will increase your score, but letting them reach the bottom of the screen will decrease it. The player can move in any direction, and can fire bullets to destroy enemies. The game will end when the player runs out of lives._

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
    -   Down: ‚¨áÔ∏è
    -   Left: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
    -   Right: ‚û°Ô∏è
-   Fire: üÖæÔ∏è (Z)

## My Additions

- _Every enemy that you allow to slip past your defenses will give a score penalty, making prioritisation and risky manoeuvres necessary to keep your high score._
- _Enemies will occasionally drop power-ups that can be collected to either increase your rate of fire or clear the screen of enemies._
- _The player's high score will be saved and displayed alongside their current score._
